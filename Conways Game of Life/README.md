CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
======

Two versions of Conway's Game of Life:

1. Procedully written
  * Written fairly quickly and abandoned in favour of the object-based version, as I was not learning anything from it.

2. Object Oriented
  * Written to understand objects and classes in Python, a continual work-in-progress
