CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE
======

First draft:
Just got it working!

Canvas renders much larger than the required space - will make it automatically scale to the size of the grid.

Random seed generation is boring to look at - need to implement a better way.

It is currently fairly inefficient - will be looked at.

OO:
Rules are not implemented correctly and some of the code is redundant/poorly written (eg the cell born/life functions) - not complicated refactoring in these cases.
